				<a><26a>Technologically advanced microspheres slowly dissolve, releasing the active ingredient moxidectin. The moxidectin redistributes from the plasma to adipose tissue, which acts as a reservoir, allowing for 6 months of sustained-release protection from heartworm disease.</26a></a>
				<a><32a>Moxidectin in ProHeart 6 continues to circulate in the blood for 6 months at high enough levels to kill larval and adult heart worms alike.</32a></a>
				<a><32a>ProHeart 6 creates a subcutaneous reservoir at the injection site which holds enough moxidectin to prevent heartworm disease for 6 months.</32a></a>
